# Breast Cancer Prediction model
Breast Cancer Prediction Model using histopathographical image data

## Detection of cancer in histopathological images
Histopathological image data makes it clear in determination of most of the breast cancer cases like Invasive Ductal Carcinoma(IDC) or also called Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma which accounts almost 80% of all breast cancer.

## Sample of histopathological image

## Model Description
This model checks whether the histopathological images are showing any signs of having a malingnent behaviour and classifies it either carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic.

## Instructions for usage
